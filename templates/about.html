			<h1> About Us </h1>
			<p> 
				My name is Omar Buenrostro.  I'm a 4th year undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science and Statistics.
			</p>  

			<p>
				Instead of giving you any more personal information, here are the lyrics to Smash Mouth's hit song <em>All Star:</em>
			</p>

			<p class="lyrics">
				Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me <br>
				I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed <br>
				She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb <br>
				In the shape of an "L" on her forehead <br><br>

				Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming <br>
				Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
				Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
				Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
				So much to do, so much to see<br>
				So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
				You'll never know if you don't go<br>
				You'll never shine if you don't glow<br><br>

				Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
				Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
				And all that glitters is gold<br>
				Only shooting stars break the mold<br><br>

				It's a cool place and they say it gets colder<br>
				You're bundled up now, wait till you get older<br>
				But the meteor men beg to differ<br>
				Judging by the hole in the satellite picture<br>
				The ice we skate is getting pretty thin<br>
				The water's getting warm so you might as well swim<br>
				My world's on fire, how about yours?<br>
				That's the way I like it and I never get bored<br><br>

				Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
				Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
				All that glitters is gold<br>
				Only shooting stars break the mold<br><br>

				Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
				Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid<br>
				And all that glitters is gold<br>
				Only shooting stars<br><br>

				Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?<br>
				I need to get myself away from this place<br>
				I said yep what a concept<br>
				I could use a little fuel myself<br>
				And we could all use a little change<br><br>

				Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming<br>
				Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running<br>
				Didn't make sense not to live for fun<br>
				Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb<br>
				So much to do, so much to see<br>
				So what's wrong with taking the back streets?<br>
				You'll never know if you don't go (go!)<br>
				You'll never shine if you don't glow<br><br>

				Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play<br>
				Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid<br>
				And all that glitters is gold<br>
				Only shooting stars break the mold<br><br>

				And all that glitters is gold<br>
				Only shooting stars break the mold
